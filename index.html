      <h1>Part-Time MBA Alumni Weekend in Berlin</h1>
      <h2>around 20th June 2025</h2>
      <p>
        We are excited to invite you to the first alumni-organized Part-Time MBA Alumni Weekend in Berlin this June.
        It is planned to be synchronized with the BPS summer party, that is scheduled for the 20th June 2025 and that some of you may be planning to attend, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to make the Part-Time MBA Alumni Weekend a unique opportunity to:
        <ul>
          <li>reconnect</li>
          <li>share professional experiences</li>
          <li>exchange ideas</li>
          <li>start establishing a strong and ever-growing network of alumni</li>
          <li>develop initiatives to support the active students and “give back” (opportunities for theses, facilitation of job search etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The initiative, supported by the school but fully organized by fellow alumni, aims to create an engaging and valuable experience through interactive formats such as (but not limited to) talks, workshops, and networking sessions.
      </p>
